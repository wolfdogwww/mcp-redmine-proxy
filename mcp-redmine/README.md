# MCP Redmine

**Status: Works great and is in daily use without any known bugs.**

**Status2: I just added the package to PyPI and updated the usage instructions. Please report any issues :)**

Let Claude be your Redmine assistant! MCP Redmine connects Claude Desktop to your Redmine instance, allowing it to:

- Search and browse projects and issues
- Create and update issues with full markdown support
- Upload and download file attachments
- Manage and track time entries
- Update issue statuses and fields
- Access comprehensive Redmine API functionality

Uses httpx for API requests and integrates with the Redmine OpenAPI specification for comprehensive API coverage.

## Usage with Claude Desktop
### 1. Installation using `uv`

Ensure you have uv installed.
```bash
uv --version
```

Install uv if you haven't already.

- Linux
  ```bash
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

- macOS
  ```zsh
  brew install uv
  ```

- windows
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "redmine": {
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["--from", "mcp-redmine==2025.09.03.141435", 
                "--refresh-package", "mcp-redmine", "mcp-redmine"],
        "env": {
          "REDMINE_URL": "https://your-redmine-instance.example.com",
          "REDMINE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
          "REDMINE_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS": "/path/to/instructions.md"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

### 2. Installation using `docker`

Ensure you have docker installed. 
```bash
docker --version
```

Build docker image:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:runekaagaard/mcp-redmine.git
cd mcp-redmine
docker build -t mcp-redmine .
```
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "redmine": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args":  [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-e", "REDMINE_URL",
            "-e", "REDMINE_API_KEY",
            "-e", "REDMINE_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS",
            "-v", "/path/to/instructions.md:/app/INSTRUCTIONS.md",
            "mcp-redmine"
        ],
        "env": {
          "REDMINE_URL": "https://your-redmine-instance.example.com",
          "REDMINE_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
          "REDMINE_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS": "/app/INSTRUCTIONS.md"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Environment Variables

- `REDMINE_URL`: URL of your Redmine instance (required)
- `REDMINE_API_KEY`: Your Redmine API key (required, see below for how to get it)
- `REDMINE_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS`: Path to a file containing additional instructions for the redmine_request tool (optional). I've found it works great to have the LLM generate that file after a session. ([example1](INSTRUCTIONS_EXAMPLE1.md) [example2](INSTRUCTIONS_EXAMPLE2.md))

> **Note**: When running via Docker, the `REDMINE_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS` environment variable must point to a **path inside the container**, not a path on the host machine.  
> Therefore, if you want to use a local file, you need to **mount it into the container** at the correct location.


## Getting Your Redmine API Key

1. Log in to your Redmine instance
2. Go to "My account" (typically found in the top-right menu)
3. On the right side of the page, you should see "API access key"
4. Click "Show" to view your existing key or "Generate" to create a new one
5. Copy this key for use in your configuration

```

### Searching for issues

```
Can you find all high priority issues in the "Website" project that are currently unassigned?
```
